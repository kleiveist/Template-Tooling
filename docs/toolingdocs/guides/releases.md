# Prepare a release

The normal command surface validates product releases but does not publish them.

## Version checks

Show the effective version and validate enabled component metadata:

```sh
python tools/control.py version
python tools/control.py version check
```

The root `VERSION` file is the product source of truth when present; otherwise the tooling falls
back to `tools/VERSION`. The check requires valid SemVer and compares the metadata of enabled
frontend and Tauri components.

To copy the product version into enabled component metadata:

```sh
python tools/control.py version sync
```

`version sync` directly changes product-owned files such as `package.json`, lockfiles,
`tauri.conf.json`, `Cargo.toml`, or `Cargo.lock` when applicable. It is not an integration
transaction. Review and commit those changes as an explicit product-version update.

## Non-publishing release gate

```sh
python tools/control.py release check
```

The gate checks applicable version metadata, project identity, desktop security/capabilities,
tag context, Git cleanliness, and signing-environment signals. A warning is evidence to review;
only a reported failure makes the command fail. The command neither uploads nor publishes an
artifact.

Run the applicable tests and builds before this gate, inspect every warning, and verify artifact
checksums and signatures using the target platform's release process.

## Export the portable tooling

```sh
python tools/control.py tooling export
python tools/control.py tooling export --output PATH
```

The default output parent is the current directory; `--output` must name an existing directory.
The command stages and validates `Template-Tooling-<version>/`, normalizes file metadata, and
publishes it only if no case-insensitive destination already exists. It never merges or replaces
an earlier export.

The result contains exactly `tools/` and `docs/toolingdocs/`. Source-only tests, repository files,
Git metadata, local state, dependency environments, logs, caches and build intermediates are not
included. The one verified Rust analyzer WASM and the Tauri `build/` source directory are narrow
policy exceptions. Symlinks, hidden runtime objects, case-folding collisions and any other
`dist/` object fail closed.

The included payload manifest verifies the exported bytes and relocation-independent paths; it
does not authenticate the source or sign the directory. Publish checksums/signatures separately,
start from a trusted pinned revision, follow the [folder replacement guide](folder-replacement.md),
and never combine files from different exports.
